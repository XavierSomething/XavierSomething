### Hello!

My name is Tyler, with a nickname of Xavier online. I'm fine with being called by either-or. 
I'm currently a Computer Science Major graduating sometime in 2028.

I'm mainly learning programming, still figuring out how github works to help with it as well. My main experience in code is in Python and Java, and I'm interested/trying to learn C++ and C#, mainly C#.
